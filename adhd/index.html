            <blockquote>
                "The task breakdown feature is life-changing. 'Write thesis chapter' becomes '1. Open document. 2. Read last paragraph. 3. Write one sentence about X.' Suddenly I can START instead of just staring at a blank screen."

                We believe in radical transparency. This is <strong>cutting-edge AI technology</strong> — powerful, transformative, and still evolving. Here's what that means:

                    <h4>Wild West Territory</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI assistants this capable are new. There's no established playbook. We're building the plane while flying it.</p>
                    <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> You're an early adopter. Things will evolve. Some features might break temporarily. Updates happen frequently. You get to shape what this becomes.</p>

                    <h4>Security & Privacy</h4>
                    <p><strong>The good:</strong> Moltbot runs on YOUR infrastructure. We don't see your data. It's not training on your conversations. You control everything.</p>
                    <p><strong>The risks:</strong> You're trusting cloud providers (your VPS host), Telegram's encryption, and open-source AI models. Nothing is 100% secure. Don't share truly sensitive data (SSNs, passwords, medical records).</p>

                    <p><strong>What AI is great at:</strong> Pattern recognition, task breakdown, reminders, research, writing assistance, accountability.</p>
                    <p><strong>What AI struggles with:</strong> Understanding complex emotional nuance, making high-stakes decisions, replacing human therapists/doctors. Moltbot is a tool, not a replacement for professional care.</p>

                    <h4>The Trade-Off</h4>
                    <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Early-stage tech, potential bugs, privacy considerations, learning curve, dependence on external services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Executive function support that actually works, 24/7 availability, massive time savings, reduced ADHD-related stress, customizable to YOUR brain, costs less than therapy.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 12px; color: #764ba2; font-weight: 600;">For many ADHD people, the benefits massively outweigh the risks. But you should decide for yourself.</p>

                🎯 <strong>Our commitment:</strong> We'll always be honest about limitations, keep improving based on your feedback, and prioritize your privacy. If you're comfortable with early-adopter territory, the upside is huge.

            <h3>🚀 How Moltbot Actually Works — The Setup</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 20px; color: #333; line-height: 1.7; font-size: 16px;">
                Here's the magic: <strong>You get your own private computer in the cloud that runs YOUR Moltbot 24/7.</strong> Think of it like having a personal assistant with their own office that never closes.
            </p>

                <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">What is Moltbot? (And why is it going viral?)</h4>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    <strong>Moltbot is NOT just a chatbot.</strong> It's built on <strong>Clawdbot</strong> — an open-source framework that combines:
                </p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Claude Code</strong> (Anthropic's coding agent) — AI that can actually write and run code</li>
                    <li><strong>Proactive scheduling</strong> — Checks in on you without you having to ask</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory & context</strong> — Remembers everything across conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>Tool integration</strong> — Connects to your calendar, email, files, APIs, everything</li>
                    <li><strong>Its own computer</strong> — Can create files, run scripts, build systems for you</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 15px; font-weight: 600; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.2); padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
                    💡 This is why it's going viral: People finally realized AI can be MORE than a chat interface. Moltbot is an AI that actually DOES things — builds systems, automates tasks, manages your life — while you just text it like a friend.

                            We set up a VPS (Virtual Private Server) for you — a private Linux computer in the cloud that runs 24/7. This is YOUR computer. We don't have access. It's isolated from other users.

                            We install Clawdbot (the framework) and connect it to Claude Code (the AI brain). Your Moltbot can now think, code, remember, and act — all running on your private server.

                            We connect your Moltbot to Telegram or WhatsApp. Now you can text it anytime, from anywhere. Behind the scenes, it's running code, managing files, and building systems — you just chat.

                    Nope! We handle the entire setup. You just need a Telegram/WhatsApp account. We provision the server, install everything, configure it for ADHD support, and hand you the keys. Takes ~15 minutes. Then you're just texting your assistant — everything technical happens invisibly in the background.

            <h3>Questions ADHD Users Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from just using ChatGPT?</summary>
                <p><strong>ChatGPT is passive</strong> — it sits there waiting for you to remember to use it. If you have ADHD, you know the problem: you forget to open the app, you get distracted, you move on.</p>
                <p><strong>Moltbot is active</strong> — it reaches out to YOU. Morning check-in. Task reminders. "Hey, you said you'd do that thing." It remembers when you forget. That's the whole point.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will this actually work for MY ADHD?</summary>
                <p>ADHD is a spectrum, and Moltbot adapts to YOUR brain. During setup, you tell it what you struggle with (time management? task initiation? forgetfulness?) and what helps you (gentle reminders? firm nudges? task breakdown?).</p>
                <p>It learns from your patterns and adjusts. If something isn't working, just tell it and it'll try a different approach.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I get annoyed by check-ins?</summary>
                <p>You control the frequency. Want check-ins every 2 hours? Daily? Only for specific tasks? Your call. You can also tell Moltbot "quiet mode today" if you need space. It's YOUR assistant.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR server (we help you set it up). Your conversations, tasks, and personal info stay with you. We never see it, train AI on it, or share it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I need to be tech-savvy?</summary>
                <p>Nope. If you can use Telegram (it's like WhatsApp), you can use Moltbot. Setup takes ~10 minutes with our guided process. After that, it's just texting your assistant.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p>Starting at <strong>$49/month</strong> for the ADHD Support plan. Less than one therapy co-pay, less than most ADHD coaching services, and available 24/7.</p>
                <p>Early access users get <strong>50% off for life</strong> ($24.50/month). Limited spots.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I forget to respond to Moltbot?</summary>
                <p>That's... kind of the point of ADHD support, right? 😊 Moltbot will follow up gently. "Hey, still stuck on that thing? Want help?" It doesn't give up on you.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can it integrate with my calendar/to-do apps?</summary>
                <p>Yes! Moltbot can read your Google Calendar, sync with Notion, Todoist, or just work standalone. Whatever fits your existing systems (or lack of system — no judgment).</p>
