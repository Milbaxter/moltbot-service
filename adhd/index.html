            <blockquote>
                "The task breakdown feature is life-changing. 'Write thesis chapter' becomes '1. Open document. 2. Read last paragraph. 3. Write one sentence about X.' Suddenly I can START instead of just staring at a blank screen."

            <h3>Questions ADHD Users Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from just using ChatGPT?</summary>
                <p><strong>ChatGPT is passive</strong> — it sits there waiting for you to remember to use it. If you have ADHD, you know the problem: you forget to open the app, you get distracted, you move on.</p>
                <p><strong>Moltbot is active</strong> — it reaches out to YOU. Morning check-in. Task reminders. "Hey, you said you'd do that thing." It remembers when you forget. That's the whole point.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will this actually work for MY ADHD?</summary>
                <p>ADHD is a spectrum, and Moltbot adapts to YOUR brain. During setup, you tell it what you struggle with (time management? task initiation? forgetfulness?) and what helps you (gentle reminders? firm nudges? task breakdown?).</p>
                <p>It learns from your patterns and adjusts. If something isn't working, just tell it and it'll try a different approach.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I get annoyed by check-ins?</summary>
                <p>You control the frequency. Want check-ins every 2 hours? Daily? Only for specific tasks? Your call. You can also tell Moltbot "quiet mode today" if you need space. It's YOUR assistant.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR server (we help you set it up). Your conversations, tasks, and personal info stay with you. We never see it, train AI on it, or share it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I need to be tech-savvy?</summary>
                <p>Nope. If you can use Telegram (it's like WhatsApp), you can use Moltbot. Setup takes ~10 minutes with our guided process. After that, it's just texting your assistant.</p>
            </details>

                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p>Starting at <strong>$49/month</strong> for the ADHD Support plan. Less than one therapy co-pay, less than most ADHD coaching services, and available 24/7.</p>
                <p>Early access users get <strong>50% off for life</strong> ($24.50/month). Limited spots.</p>

                <summary>What if I forget to respond to Moltbot?</summary>
                <p>That's... kind of the point of ADHD support, right? 😊 Moltbot will follow up gently. "Hey, still stuck on that thing? Want help?" It doesn't give up on you.</p>

                <summary>Can it integrate with my calendar/to-do apps?</summary>
                <p>Yes! Moltbot can read your Google Calendar, sync with Notion, Todoist, or just work standalone. Whatever fits your existing systems (or lack of system — no judgment).</p>
