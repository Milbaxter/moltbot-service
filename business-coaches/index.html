            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What if I'm not technical?</h4>
                <p>
                    Perfect — that's exactly why we built this. You don't need to know anything about APIs or cloud servers. We handle all technical setup. You just text via Telegram (like texting a friend).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is my client information safe?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Moltbot runs in an isolated cloud sandbox with no access to your computer, email, or files. The only way to interact is through Telegram. Your conversations stay on your dedicated instance. We can't see them. Client confidentiality is preserved.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What kind of content can it create?</h4>
                <p>
                    Program modules, exercises, worksheets, homework assignments, action plans, follow-up emails, session agendas, coaching frameworks, client resources, and more. It's like having a content team on call 24/7.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How much time will this save me?</h4>
                <p>
                    Most coaches report 5-10 hours per week. Session prep drops from 30-60 min to 5 minutes. Content creation from hours to minutes. Client research from never/rarely to always prepared. The time compounds week after week.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Can it help with different coaching niches?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Business coaching, executive coaching, leadership coaching, career coaching, life coaching — it adapts to your niche. You guide it with your requests, and it delivers relevant content and research.

                <p>
                    Yes. Cancel your subscription anytime from the Stripe portal. We'll keep your bot running through the end of your billing period, then send you a backup before shutting it down.
