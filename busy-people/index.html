            <h3>Questions People Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I need to be tech-savvy?</summary>
                <p>Not at all. If you can text your friends, you can use Moltbot. We set up everything for you. You just install Telegram or WhatsApp (free apps) and start texting.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I don't understand how to ask for something?</summary>
                <p>Just say it however it comes to mind. "I need to figure out dinner for tonight and I'm too tired to think" — Moltbot understands vague. You don't need perfect instructions.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is it actually private and secure?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR private cloud server (we set it up for you). Your messages, calendar, info — it's all yours. We don't see it. No one trains AI on it. You own everything.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can it actually book things or just give suggestions?</summary>
                <p>Both. Moltbot can book appointments, make reservations, purchase items, schedule meetings — whatever you authorize it to do. You're always in control.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What happens if it doesn't understand something?</summary>
                <p>It asks. "Did you mean [this]?" or "I'm not sure — can you clarify?" Just like texting a real assistant. Conversation, not commands.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is this really available 24/7?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Text at 3 AM if inspiration strikes. Text from vacation. Text while commuting. Moltbot is always there, always working in the background.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p><strong>$89.99/month.</strong> Less than hiring an assistant for even 2 hours. Unlimited tasks, 24/7 availability, full setup and support included.</p>
