                    <p>"You said you'd email Sarah by 3pm. It's 2:45. Ready?" — Moltbot doesn't forget. Even when you do. It checks in. Gently. Consistently. Without judgment.</p>

            <h3>Questions People Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Will this actually work for me?</summary>
                <p>If you forget things, struggle to start tasks, lose track of time, or need external accountability — yes. Moltbot is built for brains that work differently. It doesn't judge, it just helps. Try it for 14 days — money-back guarantee if it doesn't help.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I get annoyed by reminders?</summary>
                <p>You control everything. Want check-ins every 2 hours? Daily? Only for specific tasks? Your call. You can also say "quiet mode today" if you need space. It adapts to YOU.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from setting phone alarms?</summary>
                <p>Phone alarms are dumb. You dismiss them and forget. Moltbot is conversational: "Ready to start that thing?" If you say "no, stuck" → it helps you get unstuck. It's support, not just a beep.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I forget to respond to Moltbot?</summary>
                <p>It follows up. "Hey, still stuck on that thing? Want help?" It doesn't give up on you. That's literally the point.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR private cloud server. Your conversations, tasks, brain dumps — all stays with you. We don't see it, don't train AI on it, don't share it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I need to be technical?</summary>
                <p>Nope. We set up everything. You just need Telegram or WhatsApp. If you can text a friend, you can use Moltbot.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p><strong>$89.99/month</strong> with full setup and support included. Less than therapy, available 24/7, and actually helps you get things done.</p>
