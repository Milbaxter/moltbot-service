            <h3>FAQ for Financial Advisors</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is this compliant with SEC/FINRA regulations?</h4>
                <p>
                    Moltbot is a research assistant tool. It doesn't provide investment advice, execute trades, or store client data. All conversations happen on your private, isolated instance. You remain in full control of all client communications and advice. We recommend discussing with your compliance officer if you have specific concerns.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What about client data privacy?</h4>
                <p>
                    Your Moltbot instance is completely isolated in the cloud. It has no access to your computer, email, CRM, or any other systems. You control what information you share via Telegram. Your conversations are never shared, never used for training, and never visible to us or anyone else.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How much time will this really save me?</h4>
                <p>
                    Most advisors report 5-10 hours per week. Prospect research drops from 2-3 hours to 15 minutes. Meeting prep from 1 hour to 10 minutes. Market research from scattered reading to on-demand briefs. The time compounds—you can finally focus on relationships instead of research.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What kind of prospect research can it do?</h4>
                <p>
                    Professional background, wealth indicators, company news, affiliations, philanthropic interests, family information, decision-making style, social media insights, recent life events, and more. It synthesizes public information into actionable intelligence for your conversations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why is this more expensive than the standard tier?</h4>
                <p>
                    The Executive Tier includes white-glove onboarding, monthly strategy calls, faster support (4-hour response), and is positioned for high-value professionals. Your time is worth $300-1000+/hour. Saving 5 hours/week delivers $6,000-20,000/month in value. $149/month is a rounding error.

                <p>
                    Yes. Cancel your subscription anytime. We'll keep your instance running through the end of your billing period, then provide a full data export before shutdown.
