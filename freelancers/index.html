            <h3>Questions Freelancers Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from ChatGPT?</summary>
                <p><strong>ChatGPT is a chat window.</strong> Moltbot is a computer in the cloud that works for you 24/7. It remembers your clients, tracks your projects, surfaces old conversations, and actually does things (research, file creation, automation) — not just answers questions.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I need it to access my calendar, email, or files?</summary>
                <p>Moltbot can integrate with Google Calendar, Gmail, Notion, Todoist, and more. During setup, you choose what to connect. It can read your calendar to schedule meetings, draft emails, search your files — whatever you authorize.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will it actually save me time or just create more work?</summary>
                <p>Zero learning curve. You text it like you'd text a human assistant. No manuals, no training, no setup complexity. Most freelancers save 10-15 hours per week after the first month. That's 2-3 extra billable days.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is my client data safe?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR private cloud server. Your client info, projects, emails — all stays on your infrastructure. We don't see it, don't store it, don't train AI on it. You own everything.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I'm not technical?</summary>
                <p>We handle 100% of setup. You just need a Telegram or WhatsApp account. After that, it's literally texting. If you can text a friend, you can use Moltbot.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p><strong>$89.99/month.</strong> Less than 2 hours of your billable rate (if you charge $50+/hour). If it saves you even 5 hours/month, you're profitable. Most users save 40+ hours/month.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I cancel anytime?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime. 14-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't save you time in the first 2 weeks, full refund.</p>

                    Want more control? You can optionally set up Moltbot with <strong>your own OpenRouter or AI API keys</strong>. This gives you direct access to usage costs and lets you choose different AI models. We'll help you configure it during setup.
