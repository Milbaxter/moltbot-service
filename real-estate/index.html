            <h3>FAQ for Realtors</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why do I need my own Anthropic API key?</h4>
                <p>
                    This keeps costs transparent and gives you control. You pay Anthropic directly for AI usage (typically $10-25/month for realtors). We never markup API costs. Plus, you get the latest Claude models immediately when Anthropic releases them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What if I'm not technical?</h4>
                <p>
                    Perfect — that's exactly why we built this. You don't need to know anything about APIs or cloud servers. We handle all the technical setup. You just need to text via Telegram (which you probably already use).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is my client data safe?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Moltbot runs in an isolated cloud sandbox with no access to your computer, email, or CRM. The only way to interact with it is through Telegram messages. Your conversations stay on your dedicated instance. We can't see them, and they're not shared with anyone.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>What kind of research can it do?</h4>
                <p>
                    Neighborhood analysis, comparable sales, school districts, demographic trends, market reports, lead background research, client preparation, listing descriptions, social media content, presentation materials — anything that requires research and writing.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How fast does it work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Simple requests (listing descriptions): 2-3 minutes. Deep research (neighborhood analysis, comps): 10-20 minutes. The key is you don't have to wait — you text the request and it delivers results to Telegram when done. You keep working.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I cancel anytime?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Cancel your subscription anytime from the Stripe portal. We'll keep your bot running through the end of your billing period, then send you a backup of your data before shutting it down.
