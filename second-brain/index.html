            <h3>Questions Second Brain Users Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Will this replace my Notion/Obsidian/Roam setup?</summary>
                <p>No — it enhances it. Keep using whatever you love. Moltbot syncs with your existing system and makes it frictionless. You get the organization you want without the maintenance you hate.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How does it organize things without me telling it where everything goes?</summary>
                <p>Moltbot reads your existing structure and learns your organizational patterns. It sees how you've categorized things before and applies the same logic. You can always override or adjust — but most of the time, it gets it right.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I have a very specific tagging system?</summary>
                <p>Tell Moltbot your system once. It applies it consistently. Way more consistent than you doing it manually when you're tired or rushed. You can even say "tag this as X" and it remembers for future similar items.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is my second brain data private?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Moltbot runs on YOUR private server. Your notes, ideas, knowledge base — all stays with you. We don't see it, don't train AI on it, don't share it. You own everything.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from Notion AI or other built-in AI features?</summary>
                <p>Notion AI helps you write. Moltbot helps you capture, organize, connect, and surface. It's proactive — "You saved this 2 months ago, relevant to what you're working on now." It works across your entire knowledge base, not just one document. And it lives in your messaging app, not buried in another tab.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I still tweak my system if I want to?</summary>
                <p>Absolutely. Moltbot handles the boring organizational overhead. You're free to spend time on the fun system design when you want to, not when you have to just to keep up with capture.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p><strong>$89.99/month</strong> with full setup and support included. Less than hiring a VA for 2 hours, available 24/7. Your private cloud server, unlimited usage, and direct support from us.</p>
