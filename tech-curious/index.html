                You've seen the demos. AI agents that run code, browse the web, manage files, automate workflows. It's cool. But the setup? Docker containers, API keys, terminal commands, debugging... forget it. <strong>What if you just got one, ready to use?</strong> We set up your own AI computer in the cloud. You text it like ChatGPT.

            <h3>Questions Tech-Curious People Ask</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I inspect the code it writes?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Everything runs on YOUR server. SSH in anytime. Every script, file, automation — it's all there. Fully transparent. You own it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I want to use my own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)?</summary>
                <p>You can. During setup, choose "bring your own API" mode. You get direct cost control and can swap models (Claude, GPT-4, open-source LLMs). We help configure it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is this actually safe? Can it run arbitrary code?</summary>
                <p>It runs on an isolated cloud server (your VPS). Can't access your local machine. Can't run amok. You approve integrations. It's as safe as any cloud service you use — but you control it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How is this different from AutoGPT / BabyAGI / other agent projects?</summary>
                <p><strong>Those require setup, configuration, and maintenance.</strong> Moltbot is turnkey. We set up your agent, you just use it. Same power, zero DevOps.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I build my own tools on top of it?</summary>
                <p>Absolutely. It's open source (Clawdbot). You can extend it, customize it, integrate it with whatever you want. We provide the foundation + hosted infrastructure.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What happens if I outgrow this?</summary>
                <p>You own the server. Export everything, migrate elsewhere, host it yourself. No lock-in. Most users stick around because the managed service is easier, but you're free to leave.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
                <p><strong>$89.99/month</strong> with full setup, hosting, and support. Includes compute costs. If you bring your own API keys, just pay for those separately.</p>
